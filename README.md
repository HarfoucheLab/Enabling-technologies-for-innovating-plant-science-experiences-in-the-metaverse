# Enabling technologies for innovating plant science experiences in the metaverse



Welcome to the 'enabling technologies for innovating plant science experiences in the metaverse' repository!

This repository aims to help users design and build immersive virtual reality (VR) experiences that enable the exploration of the plant science world in the metaverse. By leveraging the power of Unity, UdonSharp, VRChat, and our Unity packages, this repository enables the creation of interactive, gamified, bias-free VR worlds and more diverse and inclusive human avatars to advance plant science education, training, research, and innovation.

The repository offers a range of exciting features and assets to enhance users' VR experience. Here's a glimpse of the content you'll find in this repository:

## Plant science and LEGO

**Build your own XyloScope using LEGO bricks.**

Immerse yourself in the captivating realm of wood anatomy with our VR-based digital XyloTron system gamification. The XyloTron is an artificial intelligence (AI) wood identification system that leverages XyloScope, a digital imaging system for viewing and recording macroscopic images of wood, to classify wood species. Our gamified Unity package allows users to design and assemble a simulated XyloScope using LEGO bricks to explore the internal structures of different wood species. See it in action in the video below:

**Image and identify wood species using LEGO XyloTron AI system.**

Engage in a hands-on experience where you'll virtually prepare, phenotype, and analyze wood samples using the designed VR-based digital XyloTron system from our Unity package. The package allows users to add a radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag to wood samples for enhanced traceability and data management which contributes to the fight against illegal logging and illegal wood trade. RFID enables automated identification and tracking of wood samples, improving inventory management and record-keeping. It aids in quality control and supply chain management, offering advantages in authenticity verification and data association and thus, helps to prevent the circulation of illegally sourced wood in the supply chain. Uncover the intricate patterns and characteristics that define each species, deepening your understanding of plant and wood science and its applications, and raising awareness on fighting illegal logging and illegal wood trade.

**Give your avatars the ability to fly.**

Soar through the virtual skies with our avatar flight system! Our unique code, built on top of UdonToolkit, allows avatars to take flight in VRChat. Experience the exhilaration of freely navigating virtual environments, unlocking new perspectives on the world of plant science. See it in action in the video below:

## Plant science and smart handheld devices

**Create, share, and collaborate using Google Slides.**

Imagine a scenario where a researchers, physically located in different parts of the world enter a virtual meeting space. Equipped with shared tablets from our Unity package, they enter a virtual workspace where Google Slides comes to life in a stunning 3D tablet. Each participant can manipulate the slides using their real tablet, adding content, rearranging elements, and effortlessly fine-tuning the presentation. The immersive nature of VR enhances the collaborative experience, allowing researchers to engage in real-time discussions, point out specific elements, and provide instant feedback, as if they were physically present in the same room. This innovative approach not only fosters creativity and efficient teamwork but also eliminates the limitations of physical distance, enabling seamless collaboration.  See it in action in the video below:

**Get immersed in informative lifelike video through screensharing.**

Leverage the power of your real phone as an interactive, gamified 3D model while immersed in a VR environment. Our Unity package transforms your real phone into a virtual object, allowing you to interact with it in the 3D space. As you navigate, you have the ability to share your real phone's screen with others. Whether it's demonstrating an app, showcasing a design, or sharing informative videos, the shared screen feature facilitates seamless communication and collaboration. This integration of real-world within a virtual setting not only amplifies the potential for interactive and immersive experiences but also bridges the gap between physical and digital realms.  See it in action in the video below:

## Plant science and 3D pen

**Handwrite, sketch, and draw in the air with 3D pen.**

The convergence of VR and the creative power of a 3D pen opens up a whole new realm of possibilities. This innovative Unity package allows you to write, draw, and design in 3D, with the ability to virtually write on notebooks, whiteboards, or any other surface. The freedom to sketch and sculpt in the air enables you to bring your imagination to life, effortlessly crafting intricate 3D models and designs. This fusion of VR and the 3D pen empowers researchers with a powerful medium for learning, communicating, and innovating plant science.  See it in action in the video below:
