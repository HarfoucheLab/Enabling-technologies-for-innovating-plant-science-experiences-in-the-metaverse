# The plant science metaverse

Welcome to 'the plant science metaverse' repository!

This repository aims to help users design and build immersive virtual reality (VR) experiences that enable the exploration of the plant science world in the metaverse. By leveraging the power of Unity, UdonSharp, VRChat, and our Unity packages, this repository enables the creation of interactive, gamified, bias-free VR worlds and more diverse and inclusive avatars to advance plant science education, training, research, and innovation.

The repository offers a range of exciting features and assets to enhance users' VR experience. Here's a glimpse of the content you'll find in this repository:

1. Avatar flight system: Soar through the virtual skies with our avatar flight system! This unique code, built on top of UdonToolkit, allows avatars to take flight in VRChat. Experience the exhilaration of freely navigating virtual environments, unlocking new perspectives on the world of plant science. See it in action in the video below:
